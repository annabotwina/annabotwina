Hi my name is @annabotwina. 
I currently graduated from Johns Hopkins University with an MS Environmental Science and Policy degree and Geographic Information Systems certificate.
In Spring 2022, I took a Programming in GIS course where I learned to use Python to create quick and easy geoprocessing scripts.
This github showcases code I have worked on throughout the semester, as well as my own water delineation script for my final project.
Thank you!
Anna
